### Why did I build this?
Over the years I've run a couple of businesses where I'd typically have to make invoices and receipts. 
I've recently found the process of creating and editing invoice templates to be quite cumbersome, particularly when I have to make invoices for a good number of clients. The process of editing and ensuring everything is as I want it to be usually takes up too much time. 
So I decided to build this app to ensure invoices and receipts can be built, reviewed and saved as PDF... all at lighting-fast speed.
